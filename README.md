## 💡 Principles of zdaj.se
Zdaj.se will **always be** a free of charge service. This is possible thanks to the following technologies and services used to build it
* Hosting – vercel.com
* Database – JSON files hosted on GitHub Pages ([https://github.com/bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-data](https://github.com/bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-data))
* Domain name – I am paying for zdaj.se domain from my own pocket (39.99 PLN/year), but whole platform is also available under https://zdaj-se.vercel.app, which will be always available free of charge
