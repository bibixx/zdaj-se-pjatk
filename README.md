## 💡 Principles of zdaj.se

Zdaj.se will **always be** a free of charge service. This is possible thanks to the following technologies and services used to build it:

- Hosting – [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Database & Files – JSON files ([bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-data](https://github.com/bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-data)) and files ([bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-files](https://github.com/bibixx/zdaj-se-pjatk-files)) stored on GitHub and served via [statically.io](https://statically.io/).
- Domain name – I am paying for zdaj.se domain from my own pocket (39.99 PLN/year), but whole platform is also available under https://zdaj-se.vercel.app, which will be always available free of charge.
